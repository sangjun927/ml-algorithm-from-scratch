# Machine Learning from Scratch
This repository is a hands-on exploration of fundamental machine learning algorithms, implemented from the ground up to understand the core logic behind each. It's a journey into the mechanics of algorithms. Please note, the focus here is on educational insight, not computational efficiency. I want to delve beyond the convenience of libraries like Scikit-learn and truly grasp the workings of machine learning algorithms.
